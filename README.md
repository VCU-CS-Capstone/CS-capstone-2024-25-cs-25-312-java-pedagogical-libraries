## Short Project Description
Giving large amounts of timely and impactful feedback is difficult because instructor time in classrooms is becoming more limited as class sizes in Computer Science continue to grow larger. So to address the scale of current classes and give students timely feedback, one way to approach it is to design impactful feedback based on observed student performance and automate its delivery so feedback can be given at scale at the moment when the student needs it as opposed to before or after.

## Project Structure
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project.
